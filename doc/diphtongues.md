# Recognizing diphtongues

This document gathers some rules about diphtongues desmabiguation. It is not exhaustive though, and in case of doubt, looking up the word in a dictionnary indicating diphtongues is necessary.

## Introduction.

The usual explanation about diphtongues does not consider the semi-vowel *u* after *g* or *q* to start diphtongues, for example *qui* is usually considered as consonant *qu* + vowel *i*, not consonant *q* + diphtongue *ui*. This is a rather arbitrary choice, but we will follow it as it seems the be the most usual convention.

As we are mostly focused on Liturgical latin where diphtongues *ae* and *oe* are noted *æ* and *œ* and thus do not constitute ambiguities in liturgical texts, we will not consider them.

With this in mind, Latin has only few possible diphtongues:

- *au* (main vowel *a*, short *u*)
- *eu* (main vowel *e*, short *u*)
- *ui* (main vowel *u*, short *i*)
- *ei* (main vowel *e*, short *i*)
- *ou* (main vowel *o*, short *u*)

which means that *ai* and *oy* are never diphtongues.

Except in modern composition, Latin has no triphtongue (the neologism maieutica could be considered one).

A good starting point for the study of diphtongues in Latin is *Vox Latina* by W.S. Allen.

## General considerations

#### general rules

A sequence of two vowels is never a diphtongue when the second one comes from a desinence: *me-us*, *e-unt*, *aure-us*. See *ei* for an exception to this rule.

#### ou

*ou* is a diphtongue only in *prout*, which makes it the easiest case.

#### au

*au* is a diphtongue most of the time: *autem*, *gaudium*, *audire*.

#### eu

*eu* is a case with many rules:

- in pure Latin, the only words with *eu* as a diphtongue are *ceu*, *seu*, *neu* and the intejections *heu* and *heus*
- *eu* is a diphtongue in Greek words: *Europa*, *Orpheus*, *euge*, *eunuchus*

#### ui

*ui* is very rarely a dipthongue: *cui* and *huic* are the most common examples.

#### ei

*ei* is quite rare as a diphtongue: *deinde*, *deinc*, *anteit*, *reice*, *aureis*. It is a diphtongue in the 5th declension contracted genitive and dative singular forms: *rei*.
