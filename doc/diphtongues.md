# Recognizing diphtongues

This document gathers some rules about diphtongues desmabiguation. It is not exhaustive though, and in case of doubt, looking up the word in a dictionnary indicating diphtongues is necessary.

Note that the document is only relevant to the modern ecclesiastic pronunciation of the prose: some hymns contain diphtongues or even triphtongues for the sake of metrics, and some diphtongues disappeared with the pronunciation reform of the XIXth century. The main source for this document is the *Liber Usualis* by Solesmes, 1961.

## Introduction.

The usual explanation about diphtongues does not consider the semi-consonnant *u* after *g* or *q* to start diphtongues, for example *qui* is usually considered as consonant *qu* + vowel *i*, not consonant *q* + diphtongue *ui*. This is a rather arbitrary choice, but we will follow it as it seems the be the most usual convention. The semi-consonnant *i* (*j*) is also not usually conceptualized as part of a diphtongue (*iam*).

As we are mostly focused on Liturgical latin where diphtongues *ae* and *oe* are noted *æ* and *œ* and thus do not constitute ambiguities in liturgical texts, we will not consider them.

With this in mind, Latin has only few possible diphtongues:

- *au* (main vowel *a*, short *u*)
- *eu* (main vowel *e*, short *u*)
- *ei* (main vowel *e*, short *i*)
- *ui* (main vowel *u*, short *i*)
- *ay* (main vowel *a*, short *y*)

which means that *ou*, *ai* and *oy* are never diphtongues.

Except in modern composition, Latin has no triphtongue (the neologism maieutica could be considered one).

A good starting point for the study of diphtongues in Latin is *Vox Latina* by W.S. Allen.

## General considerations

#### general rules

A sequence of two vowels is never a diphtongue when the second one comes from a desinence: *me-us*, *e-unt*, *aure-us*.

#### ay

*ay* is rare but always a diphtongue (*Raymundus*).

#### au

*au* is a diphtongue most of the time: *autem*, *gaudium*, *audire*.

#### eu

*eu* is a case with many rules:

- in pure Latin, *eu* can be a dipthongue only after *c*, *s* or *n* (*neuter*, *seu*), and in the intejections *heu!* and *heus!*
- *eu* is a diphtongue in Greek words: *Europa*, *Orpheus*, *euge*, *eunuchus*

#### ui

*ui* is used as a diphtongue only by some Abbeys not respecting the pronunciation reform: *cui* and *huic* are the most common examples.

#### ei

*ei* is a diphtongue only in the interjection *hei!*.


## Disambiguation of sequences of vowels

The only ambiguity for sequence of vowels seems to be *qui+vowel* and *gui+vowel*. For these, the rule seems to be to cut after the *i*, ex: *re-qui-em*.
