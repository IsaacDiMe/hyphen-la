# Latin hyphenation resources

This repository aims at providing useful programs and resources for Latin hyphenation. It is based on the work by Claudio Beccari (who is also one of the main contributor to this repository), with the aim to spread his work and improve it through feedback of some Monasteries using the patterns for their liturgical books.

See [patterns](patterns) directory for the different patterns.

See [doc](doc) directory for some documentation.

See [tests][tests] directory for some tests.
