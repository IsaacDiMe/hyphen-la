The file [listwords.txt](listwords.txt) is a list of words come from multiple sources listing difficult hyphenations.

The file [proofreading-Solesmes-1.txt](proofreading-Solesmes-1.txt) is a list of hyphenations that has been proofread by Solesmes. The `%ét` indicate an hyphenation implied by etymology.

The file [orberg.txt](orberg.txt) contains a list of etymological hyphenation points given in Hans Ørberg's method. It does not mark all hyphenation points though.
