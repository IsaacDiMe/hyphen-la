# Latin hyphenation tests

This directory contains some interesting tests for an hyphenation algorithm. 

The file [listwords.txt](listwords.txt) is a list of words come from multiple sources listing difficult hyphenations.

The files `proofreading-x-y.txt` are lists of hyphenated words reviewed by Claudio Beccari, Solesmes Abbey and Flavigny Abbey.

The file [orberg.txt](orberg.txt) contains a list of etymological hyphenation points given in Hans Ã˜rberg's method. It does not mark all hyphenation points though.
