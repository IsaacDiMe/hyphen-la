# Latin hyphenation tests

This directory contains some interesting tests for an hyphenation algorithm. 

The file [listwords.txt](listwords.txt) is a list of words come from multiple sources listing difficult hyphenations.

The file [proofreading-Solesmes-1.txt](proofreading-Solesmes-1.txt) is a list of hyphenations that has been proofread by Solesmes. The `%ét` indicates an hyphenation implied by etymology.

The file [proofreading-Flavigny-text-1.txt](proofreading-Flavigny-text-1.txt) is a list of hyphenations that has been proofread by Flavigny, specifying that this hyphenation is for text and may not be appropriate to Gregorian scores.

The file [orberg.txt](orberg.txt) contains a list of etymological hyphenation points given in Hans Ørberg's method. It does not mark all hyphenation points though.
